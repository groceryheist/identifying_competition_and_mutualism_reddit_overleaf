[X] Add isolates to networks / remake networks with consistent sizes and files. 
[X] Add means and units to irfs
[X] Resolve inconsistency between probability cutoffs. 
[X] Rewrite theory section ("strongly related groups") and sharp contribution.
[X] Put prior notion in appendix / online supplement.
[X] Do a pass
[X] ?Stability analysis.? 
[X] Emphasize in the introduction that we can answer new critical questions like "Which are a given communities strongest competitors and mutualists?"
[X] Don't use ''organizational ecology" in the intro. Define it in the background section.
[X] Split methods section between existing work done on VAR and my own contributions.
[X] Explain why the simulation in more depth in a new paragraph.
[X] Explain why we're doing case studies and what we expect to learn from them in a new paragraph.
[X] Move the results into the case studies. One case study at a time. No subsections for results. 
[X] Gesture at possible concrete mechanisms for mutualism and competition in the case studies.
[X] Forget probablistic language in the results section, be explicit about which credible interval we're talking about.
[X] Make sure there are no "online communities" anywhere.
[X] Make sure that I have introductory and transition sentences throughout. 
[X] Point folks to the online supplement.
[X] Put the priors in the appendix at the end of the document.
[X] Take a look at the Canova book to get the argument for Bayesian VARs right.
[X] Be consistent about the name of the third case study. It should be "design and craft humor.
[X] Point out that we exclude the diagonal of Phi in interpreting our models.
[X] Glue sentences at beginnings of sections
[X] Fix references. 

[X] Put full IRFs [X] and coefs [X] in the online supplement.
[X] Use "CI" instead of credible interval.
[X] Polish figure captions
[X] Conclusion is a summary. Think of a punchier conclusion.
[ ] Look in grant proposal for implications ideas.
[X] Make colors in the supplement match the network diagrams.
[X] Cite Gellman to note that the Bayesian approach provides shrinkage and thereby corrects for multiple hypothesis testing. 
[X] Make simulation coef plot more compact
[ ] Capitalization in facets / labels. (Save it for the rebuttal.)
[ ] Point out that mutualism is more common than competition in the discussion
[ ] Make sure we have  


P2:
[Won't DO] Put the big simulation in the online supplement. 
[ ] Add \Description text to plots for accessibility.
