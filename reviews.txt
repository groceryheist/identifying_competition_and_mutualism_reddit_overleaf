=== Meta Review ===
The authors mostly agree that the paper makes a contribution to our understanding of the growth of online communities through an interesting and novel approach. However, they also agree that it is currently very hard to see that contribution and its value (especially for the CSCW community) unless the authors completely restructure and improve the presentation of the paper. I believe that if the authors are able to address these presentation issues, the paper could become a valuable contribution to CSCW.

The authors should address all comments made by the reviewers, but they may want to focus on the following:

1. Improve presentation. As mentioned above, this is the most important issue. The authors may choose a structure (as suggested by review 1) such as Intro, Related Work, Materials & Methods, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion that would make it easier for the reader to follow the narrative of the paper. The contribution of the paper should be spelled out more concretely and it should be consistent with the phrasing of the research questions. The goals and contributions of the paper should be presented much earlier. The paper should be writing keeping in mind that most CSCW readers will not have much or any background in ecology. Thus, ecology jargon should be either explained or avoided (if not needed). Finally, the paper should more directly address why their contributions are important for the CSCW literature (see review 2). I want to highlight that the requested changes in the presentation are not minor. In our discussion of what it would take for the paper to be accepted, the necessary presentation changes were characterized as "a major restructuring" and a "drastic improvement."

2. There are some potential inaccuracies (or perhaps confusion) as well as some contradictions in the discussion of ecology that should be clarified or rectified (see review 3).

3. It would be ideal if the authors could provide some type of validation of the outcome of the clustering procedure. While this is addressed in the "threats to validity" section, the reviewers would prefer to see some attempt at validation rather than having it just listed as a limitation (see review 1).

The authors propose a framework for estimating the growth of online communities based on the explicit modelling of commensal relationships between communities. However, the authors do not clearly idnetify this as their main contribution: the RQ1 reads more like an empirical question of what different types of ecologies may be found in the online communities. Therefore I was left wondering for the most of the paper whether the intended contribution of the paper is theoretical, methodological, or empirical.

The proposed framework (i.e., the methodological contribution) is of a great importance for the study of growth and sustainability of online communities. Also, gaining new empirical insights into this question is important for our community.

The framework is generally sound, the statistical methods are valid. The possibility to interpret the community matrix and perform further calculations with this matrix are extremely useful. The only part oif the framework, which is prone to problems is clustering. The authors themselves mention this in their limitation section. However, I think that some additional steps can be taken to evaluate the quality of clusteing, e.g., computing some clustering metrics such as silhoutte coefficient. Also, the authors could make this element of their framework exchangable and allow for alternative algorithms, approaches or even manual definitions of the groups that they investigate.

How well does the paper communicate the work and contribution to a CSCW audience (including situating the work in the context of the research literature)?

The major drawback of the paper is presentation. I think that the work that the authors did is substantial and it deserves publication since it will make a significant contribution to our community. However, in the current form the paper can not be published and requires major revisions. In particular:
- I have already mentioned above that the intented contribution of the paper is not clear. On one hand, the authors present the framework, on the other hand the RQ suggests something else. This lack of the focus needs to be improved.
- The authors need to clearly state up front what the paper is about, what is the problem they address, why the problem is important, how the problem is addressed, what insights they gained, etc. In the current version, only in the 6th paragraph of the introduction the authors write about their work and their contribution. This same pattern is also visible in the abstract. Only in the last two sentences do authors write about their own work. Finally, RQ is introduced on page 6 as a part of Section 3! The RQ needs to be specified in the introduction.
- The paper needs a complete restructuring. Apart from the problems mentioned above, there is a complete mixture of methods, results, and related work. For example, in Section 4.4. which introduces their own methods, the authors still have long paragraphs on related work. The paper can be structured in the following way: Intro (see above), Related Work (including all the basic methods that the authors build on and a description how the present work differs from the related work), Materials & Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion.
- Proof reading is missing, e.g., check the first paragraph od Section 5.2.: there are full stops missing, sentences begin with a small letter, etc.

Apart from the presentation issues, the methods, the results and the claims are good.

This paper provides a theoretical framework to understand how different online groups relate and interact with each other. Running a case study on Reddit communities, the authors take an exploratory approach to discover different types of ecological communities. For this purpose, the authors use network features in their analysis.

***Major issues***

1- Online groups and communities are in the interest scope of the CSCW research community. However, the way authors have explained their work makes me feel that their paper might be more appropriate for the conferences like GROUP or ASONAM. Since CSCW is a general audience, the authors need to do a deep **major revision** in their **writing and presentation** to make this work suitable for the CSCW audience.

For an HCI and CSCW researcher who is not familiar with community ecology’s terminologies, the manuscript is a little bit bumpy. I mean, it is hard to finish a section without the need to check several other references. The authors do not need to introduce every terminology in the field in their paper if they are not going to use it (my opinion). I think it is the authors’ responsibility to make sure their writing is as digestible and as straightforward as possible.

Furthermore, I wouldn’t say I liked how biology terminologies were used to explain community ecology phenomena. It is a little bit distracting, I guess.

2- The authors could have done better to show their contributions to the CSCW research community. Could authors add a section and describe their contributions to the CSCW research community more clearly? Who are the intended audiences of this work exactly? Why is it **timely** to conduct this research now? What are the true knowledge aspect of this work?

3- The discussion section is also shallow and not critical. I think this is the part the authors can shine, but currently, there are no significant or surprising implications. Hence, I suggest the authors work on this point by expanding this section, moving away from the anecdotal references.

***Minor issues***
1- I suggest the authors put their research question and hypotheses into a single exclusive section or somewhere distinct in the introduction. Generally, more organization would help with readers’ comprehension.

2- Can section 4 go before section 3?

3- Since the work is mostly a case study on Reddit, I want to know to what extent is this work **generalizable**.

4- The meaning of o_{i,j} is not explicitly mentioned in the text.

5- formula 3: change j!=i to j $\neq$ i (! Can be confused with factorial)

6- Wikipedia’s decline?

Review
What is the intended contribution of the paper?
- The paper provides a theoretical framework of using a common environmental effect to understand the effect of aggregating inter-group relationships.

How important / novel is the intended contribution of the paper?
- The contribution of the paper is of particular interest to the CSCW community. The novelty lies in the framework being proposed here. The community ecology approach for social computing is new.

How well does the paper execute this contribution?
- The research questions in the paper are well-answered and the contributions are built on a foundation of thorough experiments. However, clarity is needed in the way ecology is discussed in the paper.

How well does the paper communicate the work and contribution to a CSCW audience (including situating the work in the context of the research literature)?
-- The paper is well-organized and mostly well-written and also addresses the CSCW community. However, the presentation of the framework needs to be improved.

Are there specific weaknesses that would undermine confidence in the paper’s claims or results?

* Data
- Subreddits where a majority of the posts were marked “NSFW” were removed. How many such subreddits were removed and what was the rationale behind this decision, especially as these communities play an equally important role in “ecology”?

* Community Ecology
- In Table 1, what is listed as “Partial Mutualism” seems to be commensalism as “one species gains benefits while those of the other species neither benefit nor are harmed.” This clarity is important for the discussion on Results, specifically the alignment of the x-axis on Figure 1.
- Overall, it is not clear as to how does a commensal relationship be mutualistic or competitive?
- Moreover, assuming that the use of the word “commensalism” is ironed out, there are contradicting statements in the text:
They can also be competitive if one group has a negative effect on the second such that growth (decline) in the first group leads to decline (growth) in the second.
“predation” (also called parasitism) refers to cases where a relationship is positive in one direction but negative in the other.
- The type of commensal relationship stated in section 3 (especially, Table 1) is wrong (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensalism#Types). Overall, there is a need to have a proper understanding of the relationships between “species” interacting in an ecosystem. The term can not be used out of context.

* Results
- Figure 1 and the associated results are confusing. How does an increase in average commensalism (x-axis) depict mutualism and competition? In commensalism, it is known that only one species benefits, and the other is indifferent. Hence, how does higher average commensalism mean mutualism?
- The discussion in Section 5 will be affected by the change in discussion in Section 3. Hence, I expect significant changes that will merit another round of reviewing.

Overall, there is an important need to overhaul the discussion of ecology and the types of relationships in section 3. This will have effects on the discussion in the succeeding sections (e.g., results in Fig 1) and on the solution to RQ1, H2 and H3.


Are there other strengths of the paper (apart from the identified contribution) that should be considered in evaluating it for CSCW?
-- Overall, the paper flows very well and is easy to follow.

Please explicitly comment on the length of the paper and make recommendations towards avoiding excessive length.
- Elaboration on data collection is needed.
