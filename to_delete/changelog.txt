We thank the reviewers and the ACs for their careful and thoughtful engagement with their paper and for their constructive feedback. We have taken seriously their criticism and undertaken a major effort to address all of the issues raised. We will begin by outlining changes that were raised in the metareview, and then turn to questions and other concerns the reviewers raised that we have attempted to resolve.   

The first of the three key issues raised by the meta review was the overall presentation of the work.  Based on their comments and the related points from all of the reviews we have: 

1. Restructured the paper to make it easier to follow the narrative.  We recognize that the organization of the initial version was ideosycratic and somewhat chaotic and have totally reorganized our presentation by breaking down our analysis into three "studies" each of which serve a distinct purpose in our narrative.  Study A is our replication of density dependence. Study B is our community ecology analysis based on vector autoregression. Study C builds on Study A and Study B with our analysis of model comparison and time series forecasting.  We have restructured our background, methods & measures, and results sections so that each proceeds from Study A to Study B and then to Study C. We believe this has made the paper much easier to follow. 

2. Removed references to RQ1 and instead frame the paper around the goal "to explain the puzzling set of findings in ecological social computing research by introducing community ecology to social computing research and resolving the mismatch between goals and analytic approach."  We concure with the reviewers that our analysis was somewhat inconsistent with the statement of RQ1 and it was not clear how that question was answered by the study. Instead of a research question we have 1 hypothesis in Study A, an exploratory data analysis in Study B and 2 hypotheses in Study C.

3. Rewritten the introduction to make our contributions to CSCW more clear. R1 pointed out that we only talked about our own work in the third paragraph of the introduction. Much too late! The new introduction is much shorter and we begin describing our study in the third paragraph. Our intended contribution to CSCW is laid out in the last sentence of the third paragraph. "This paper seeks to explain the puzzling set of findings in ecological social computing research by introducing community ecology." At an intermediate stage of our revisions process, we had enumerated a number of more granular conceptual and empirical contributions to CSCW that we see in our work.  However, we have chosen to err on the side of brevity and not to go into such detail in this submission.  If the reviewers think a more granular enumeration of the contributions would be better, we would be happy to provide this.

4. The AC and all three reviewers found the extent of jargon from ecology theory and biology distracting or confusing.  It seems clear that keeping it to a minimum is the right thing to do for this audience.  Therefore, we have removed all biological references and kept the ecological jargon to a minimum set of terms that are essential to our contributions.  We have been diligent to define each such term in its first use.  As part of this we have removed the table of different possible types of interactions.  Terms like "partial mutualism" or "predation" were not helpful enough and apt to be confusing.  Instead, we use plainer language for describe example networks.

The second major issue raised by the AC relates to R3's questions about the definition of the term "commensalism" in our initial submission. At issue is a difference in terminology between organizational ecology and biology.  In organizational ecology, which is our primary ecological influence, "commensalism" is predomintely used as it was in the initial submission.  However, biologists use the term quite differently to mean an unreciprocated mutualistic interaction or what the initial submission reffered to as "partial mutualism." In our new version we have dropped the term "commensalism" because it is so prone to cause confusion. Indeed, even among organizational ecologists there are conflicting meanings of the term. For biologists, the term "biological interaction" corresponds to the types of relationships we analyze. In our new submission we have introduced a new term "ecological interaction" to refer to mutualistic and competitive relations between online groups.

The third major issue raised by the AC and also by R1 is the validity of our clustering procedure. The clustering from our original submission had a sillouette coefficient of 0.07, suggesting that some of our clusters were overlapping.  We took this threat to validity quite seriously and revisited and substantially reworked our clustering procedure by trying additional algorithms with a more thorough clustering selection procedure.  We ran a grid sweep cluster selection procedure using affinity propagation, kmeans, and (H)DBSCAN algorithms. In the course of this work we also found that performing latent semantic analysis (LSA) on the author similarity matrix before taking cosine similarities substantially improved the silhouette scores and the face validity of our clustering and similarity measures. We selected the algorithm and hyperparameters with the best silhouette coefficient that assigned at least 5,000 subreddits to a cluster, and that found at least 50 clusters. We found that the HDBSCAN algorithm provided greatly improved performance in terms of the sillouette coefficient, but also greatly increased the number of isolated subreddits. This suggests that our initial analysis included too many subreddits that did not really belong to an ecological community.  Our theory and methods are concerned foremost with groups of highly related subreddits and therefore a clustering with large number of isolated subreddits is preferrable. 

We additionally validate this clustering with the help of an undergraduate research assistant who examined a random sample of 100 clusters including 722 subreddis and labeled subreddits that did not belong to the cluster they had been assigned according to her examination of the subreddits and her own judgement.  Using her labels, we additionally calculate the "purity" evaluation criterion as 0.925. We are extremely greatful to the reviewers for raising this point as these additional steps have substantially increased our own confidence in our findings.

As a consequence of changing our clustering procedure, a few other pieces of our paper have changed.  Most notably, our result for H2 has changed from positive and significant into a null finding.  This is most likely because of the reduciton in sample size resulting from our improved clustering procedure. This change in findings promted us to reconsider the complementary roles of population ecology and community ecology in future research and influenced other improvements in our discussion.  Our other findings including density-dependence, the predominance and strength of mutualistic interactions, and the improvement in time series forecasting have changed numerically but not substantively. 

 In addition, our loglinear regression models have changed in that we do not log-transform our measure of user overlap density before fitting the models.  The original measure of user overlap density was highly skewed and required log-transformation, but our density measure based on LSA is much more evenly distributed seen in Figure 1. Finally, we have replaced the case studies in our revised section §4.2.2 with new examples because the original examples either were dropped from the new dataset or no longer met the case selection criteria.

We now turn to other points raised by reviewers that we have addressed. 

- R1 specifically suggested moving some of the methodological background into the background section, while R2 suggests moving some of our measures  before section 3.  We tried these ideas out in our revisions, but found that it was difficult to introduce technical aspects of clustering or VAR models earlier in the paper without making the narrative of the paper feel disjointed. We hope that a parallel structure in the background, methods and results broken down into three studies will serve the purpose. 

- R3 asked about our removal of NSFW subreddits. We now report the the number of NSFW subreddits (702) that were larger than the smallest SFW subreddit in the top 10,000 that we selected analysis and add explanation of why we remove them.  

- R2 asks about suggested adding a section to better explain contributions to the CSCW community and address the timeliness of the research.  To this effect we have added two new paragraphs at the beginning of our our revised §2 that articulate why the growth of online groups is important to study and how our work contributes to a recent and vibrant CSCW literature on overlapping communities.  

- R2 offered comments to encourage us to make our discussion section "shine." We have rewritten our discussion to more deeply reflect on our results, articulate complementary roles for population and community ecology in future research, and raise new connections to aspects of ecological theory that are promising new directions. In particular, we consider how theories of specialization from organizational ecology as well as evolutionary theory are potential mechanisms for explaining the observed predominance of mutualism.  We also incorporate our explanation for the puzzling findings from prior population ecology work in social computing, which was previously in the background so as to connect it to our findings. We also add some new ideas for future work.     

- R2 also raises a few minor issues we will address by. 
  1. Explicitly explaining the meaning of o_{i,j}.
  2. Noting that our findings may not generalize to other settings in our §5
  3. Use $\neq$ instead of !=
  4. Cutting the reference to Wikipedia's decline

~~~~~NOTES~AND~REVIEWS~BELOW~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will report the total number of subreddits in the full pushshift dataset and report summary statistics about the sizes and degrees of user overlap in our analyzed sample. - 

I plan to take R1's suggestion. This will help shorten the methods section and improve organization. R1 also specifically suggests stating the research question in the introduction. I might not do this explicitly, but will state some version of it. Similarly, R2 suggests putting all the hypotheses and research questions in a single section. 


1. Overall presentation:
   a) restructure to make it easier to follow the narrative
   b) rephrase contributions to correspond with research questions
   c) layout contributions in the short introduction
   d) explain necessary ecological terminology and cut and unnecessary jargon
   c) directly explain why contributions are important to the ecology literature
2. Clarify inaccuracies / confusion in discussion of ecology
3. Validate clustering procedure.

To address 3. I will take R1's suggestion to check the "sillouette coefficient" for the clusters.  I will also verify that the clusters have similar topics by checking the "silloutte coefficient" based on tf-idf similarity to provide additional valididation of the measurement.    

Although improving our clustering algorithm did not substantively affect the broader takeaways about the prevalence and strength of mutualism, it did involve significant reconfiguration of the clustering assignments.  This required us to select new case studies to illustrate our typology of ecological communities.  

Under 1. above, R1 suggests making our own contributions more clear earlier both in the introduction and in the abstract.  

R2 finds some biological terminology confusing. It might make sense to move these to footnotes and use hypothetical examples from online communities.  Similarly R3 says "it is not clear as to how does a commensal relationship be competitive or mutualistic." They don't understand what "commensalism" means, so I'm not 100% how to interpret this, but I think they might like a more concrete explanation of how competition or mutualism might arise. 

R2 also suggests claiming contributions to the CSCW community more clearly, including addressing the intended audiences and ***timeliness*** of the work. (Though timeliness as a criteria annoys). I haven't the foggiest what "true knoweldge aspect" means. 

R2 also asks that we expand and polish the discussion and describe new significant or surprising implications while cutting "anectotal references."


R3 questions our removal of NSFW subreddits.  We excluded this because we did not wish to visit these subreddits to spot check and validate our results. We will rerun our analysis including such subreddits as a robustness check and report the number that were excluded from the main analysis.  These likely play an important role in the population ecology, but are also likely to be relatively separate from the local community ecology analysis that's the main subject of our analysis.

R3 is confused about symmetric and asymmetric forms of commensalism. This is one of the most challenging pieces of feedback to address. I think we should probably gloss over the fact that the background literature draws a distinction between symettric and asymmetric forms of commensalism and just take it for granted that we are looking at directed relations. This will be more familiar to computer scientists and probably to social scientists too.  I don't think we have the space to really develop the theoretical or practical significance of symmetric vs asymmetric relationships.

R3 cites Wikipedia to say that our typology of commensalism is wrong and thereby is horribly confused. The Wikipedia article is about the concept in biology. The concept in organization science is different and corresponds to the concept of "biological interaction" in biology. Maybe it would help to explain that the term gets used in different ways by different scholarly communities and this can be confusing; we're picking up our terminology from organizational ecologists, who use a different terminology from biologists.  Alternatively, it might be best to switch to "ecological interactions", "inter-group interactions" or another term instead of commensalism.  I might like some guidance from the reviewers on this. Would they rather have a. better explain the background of "commensalism" or b. adopt a novel term that's not used in other fields?  

In summary, these are some pretty great reviews. R1 and R2 understood the paper have some issues with the framing and organization. They very helpfully tell us 80% of what to do to fix it. R3 loves the paper, says it was easy to follow 🙄, but was super confused by the term "commensalism" (ironically, by Wikipedia). 


=== Meta Review ===
The authors mostly agree that the paper makes a contribution to our understanding of the growth of online communities through an interesting and novel approach. However, they also agree that it is currently very hard to see that contribution and its value (especially for the CSCW community) unless the authors completely restructure and improve the presentation of the paper. I believe that if the authors are able to address these presentation issues, the paper could become a valuable contribution to CSCW.

The authors should address all comments made by the reviewers, but they may want to focus on the following:

1. Improve presentation. As mentioned above, this is the most important issue. The authors may choose a structure (as suggested by review 1) such as Intro, Related Work, Materials & Methods, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion that would make it easier for the reader to follow the narrative of the paper. The contribution of the paper should be spelled out more concretely and it should be consistent with the phrasing of the research questions. The goals and contributions of the paper should be presented much earlier. The paper should be writing keeping in mind that most CSCW readers will not have much or any background in ecology. Thus, ecology jargon should be either explained or avoided (if not needed). Finally, the paper should more directly address why their contributions are important for the CSCW literature (see review 2). I want to highlight that the requested changes in the presentation are not minor. In our discussion of what it would take for the paper to be accepted, the necessary presentation changes were characterized as "a major restructuring" and a "drastic improvement."

2. There are some potential inaccuracies (or perhaps confusion) as well as some contradictions in the discussion of ecology that should be clarified or rectified (see review 3).

3. It would be ideal if the authors could provide some type of validation of the outcome of the clustering procedure. While this is addressed in the "threats to validity" section, the reviewers would prefer to see some attempt at validation rather than having it just listed as a limitation (see review 1).

=== R1 ===

The authors propose a framework for estimating the growth of online communities based on the explicit modelling of commensal relationships between communities. However, the authors do not clearly idnetify this as their main contribution: the RQ1 reads more like an empirical question of what different types of ecologies may be found in the online communities. Therefore I was left wondering for the most of the paper whether the intended contribution of the paper is theoretical, methodological, or empirical.

The proposed framework (i.e., the methodological contribution) is of a great importance for the study of growth and sustainability of online communities. Also, gaining new empirical insights into this question is important for our community.

The framework is generally sound, the statistical methods are valid. The possibility to interpret the community matrix and perform further calculations with this matrix are extremely useful. The only part of the framework, which is prone to problems is clustering. The authors themselves mention this in their limitation section. However, I think that some additional steps can be taken to evaluate the quality of clusteing, e.g., computing some clustering metrics such as silhoutte coefficient. Also, the authors could make this element of their framework exchangable and allow for alternative algorithms, approaches or even manual definitions of the groups that they investigate.

How well does the paper communicate the work and contribution to a CSCW audience (including situating the work in the context of the research literature)?

The major drawback of the paper is presentation. I think that the work that the authors did is substantial and it deserves publication since it will make a significant contribution to our community. However, in the current form the paper can not be published and requires major revisions. In particular:
- I have already mentioned above that the intented contribution of the paper is not clear. On one hand, the authors present the framework, on the other hand the RQ suggests something else. This lack of the focus needs to be improved.
- The authors need to clearly state up front what the paper is about, what is the problem they address, why the problem is important, how the problem is addressed, what insights they gained, etc. In the current version, only in the 6th paragraph of the introduction the authors write about their work and their contribution. This same pattern is also visible in the abstract. Only in the last two sentences do authors write about their own work. Finally, RQ is introduced on page 6 as a part of Section 3! The RQ needs to be specified in the introduction.
- The paper needs a complete restructuring. Apart from the problems mentioned above, there is a complete mixture of methods, results, and related work. For example, in Section 4.4. which introduces their own methods, the authors still have long paragraphs on related work. The paper can be structured in the following way: Intro (see above), Related Work (including all the basic methods that the authors build on and a description how the present work differs from the related work), Materials & Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion.
- Proof reading is missing, e.g., check the first paragraph od Section 5.2.: there are full stops missing, sentences begin with a small letter, etc.

Apart from the presentation issues, the methods, the results and the claims are good.

This paper provides a theoretical framework to understand how different online groups relate and interact with each other. Running a case study on Reddit communities, the authors take an exploratory approach to discover different types of ecological communities. For this purpose, the authors use network features in their analysis.

***Major issues***

1- Online groups and communities are in the interest scope of the CSCW research community. However, the way authors have explained their work makes me feel that their paper might be more appropriate for the conferences like GROUP or ASONAM. Since CSCW is a general audience, the authors need to do a deep **major revision** in their **writing and presentation** to make this work suitable for the CSCW audience.

For an HCI and CSCW researcher who is not familiar with community ecology’s terminologies, the manuscript is a little bit bumpy. I mean, it is hard to finish a section without the need to check several other references. The authors do not need to introduce every terminology in the field in their paper if they are not going to use it (my opinion). I think it is the authors’ responsibility to make sure their writing is as digestible and as straightforward as possible.

Furthermore, I wouldn’t say I liked how biology terminologies were used to explain community ecology phenomena. It is a little bit distracting, I guess.

2- The authors could have done better to show their contributions to the CSCW research community. Could authors add a section and describe their contributions to the CSCW research community more clearly? Who are the intended audiences of this work exactly? Why is it **timely** to conduct this research now? What are the true knowledge aspect of this work?

3- The discussion section is also shallow and not critical. I think this is the part the authors can shine, but currently, there are no significant or surprising implications. Hence, I suggest the authors work on this point by expanding this section, moving away from the anecdotal references.

***Minor issues***
1- I suggest the authors put their research question and hypotheses into a single exclusive section or somewhere distinct in the introduction. Generally, more organization would help with readers’ comprehension.

2- Can section 4 go before section 3?

3- Since the work is mostly a case study on Reddit, I want to know to what extent is this work **generalizable**.

4- The meaning of o_{i,j} is not explicitly mentioned in the text.

5- formula 3: change j!=i to j $\neq$ i (! Can be confused with factorial)

6- Wikipedia’s decline?

Review
What is the intended contribution of the paper?
- The paper provides a theoretical framework of using a common environmental effect to understand the effect of aggregating inter-group relationships.

How important / novel is the intended contribution of the paper?
- The contribution of the paper is of particular interest to the CSCW community. The novelty lies in the framework being proposed here. The community ecology approach for social computing is new.

How well does the paper execute this contribution?
- The research questions in the paper are well-answered and the contributions are built on a foundation of thorough experiments. However, clarity is needed in the way ecology is discussed in the paper.

How well does the paper communicate the work and contribution to a CSCW audience (including situating the work in the context of the research literature)?
-- The paper is well-organized and mostly well-written and also addresses the CSCW community. However, the presentation of the framework needs to be improved.

Are there specific weaknesses that would undermine confidence in the paper’s claims or results?

* Data
- Subreddits where a majority of the posts were marked “NSFW” were removed. How many such subreddits were removed and what was the rationale behind this decision, especially as these communities play an equally important role in “ecology”?

* Community Ecology
- In Table 1, what is listed as “Partial Mutualism” seems to be commensalism as “one species gains benefits while those of the other species neither benefit nor are harmed.” This clarity is important for the discussion on Results, specifically the alignment of the x-axis on Figure 1.
- Overall, it is not clear as to how does a commensal relationship be mutualistic or competitive?
- Moreover, assuming that the use of the word “commensalism” is ironed out, there are contradicting statements in the text:
They can also be competitive if one group has a negative effect on the second such that growth (decline) in the first group leads to decline (growth) in the second.
“predation” (also called parasitism) refers to cases where a relationship is positive in one direction but negative in the other.
- The type of commensal relationship stated in section 3 (especially, Table 1) is wrong (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensalism#Types). Overall, there is a need to have a proper understanding of the relationships between “species” interacting in an ecosystem. The term can not be used out of context.

* Results
- Figure 1 and the associated results are confusing. How does an increase in average commensalism (x-axis) depict mutualism and competition? In commensalism, it is known that only one species benefits, and the other is indifferent. Hence, how does higher average commensalism mean mutualism?
- The discussion in Section 5 will be affected by the change in discussion in Section 3. Hence, I expect significant changes that will merit another round of reviewing.

Overall, there is an important need to overhaul the discussion of ecology and the types of relationships in section 3. This will have effects on the discussion in the succeeding sections (e.g., results in Fig 1) and on the solution to RQ1, H2 and H3.


Are there other strengths of the paper (apart from the identified contribution) that should be considered in evaluating it for CSCW?
-- Overall, the paper flows very well and is easy to follow.

Please explicitly comment on the length of the paper and make recommendations towards avoiding excessive length.
- Elaboration on data collection is needed.
